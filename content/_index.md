Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a software engineer based in New York City. I work primarily on cloud instrastructure, and by happenstance mostly at fintechs.


In my free time, you can catch me 🎻 practicing the violin, 🎮 playing video games, 🍳 cooking, or 🧗 using my
height to gain an unfair advantage at the climbing gym.
Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around! (oops: 🖕)
