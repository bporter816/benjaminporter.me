Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a software engineer at [Affirm](https://affirm.com/).
I work on the infrastructure team, and some of my current projects involve caching and security.
Most of my previous work has been in backend engineering, so working in infrastructure has definitely
been a new experience for me.

I'm based remotely out of Austin, TX and I studied computer science at UT Austin.
I've had internships at [Koddi](https://koddi.com/) and [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/).
In my free time, you can catch me practicing the violin, playing video games, and cooking.

Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around! 😑
