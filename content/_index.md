Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a software engineer at [Ramp](https://ramp.com/) based in New York City.
I've previously worked at [Affirm](https://affirm.com/) and had internships at
[Koddi](https://koddi.com/) and [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/).
I work on cloud infrastructure, and some past projects have dealt with Redis, secrets management,
and traffic routing.

In my free time, you can catch me 🎻 practicing the violin, 🎮 playing video games, 🍳 cooking, or 🧗 using my
height to gain an unfair advantage at the climbing gym.
Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around!
